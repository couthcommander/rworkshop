## R Package Challenge

The first time you install a package within a new R session, you must select the CRAN mirror.  Usually the best choice is the repository that is geographically closest to you.  Once selected subsequent package installations will use this same server.

What command allows you to select a new CRAN mirror?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
chooseCRANmirror()
```

How do you manually specify the default repository?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
options(repos = "http://debian.mc.vanderbilt.edu/R/CRAN/")
```
